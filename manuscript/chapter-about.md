# About

A few years ago, whilst I was trying to teach myself R programming, I used Formula One data as a context for my 
learning explorations, writing up what I learned in *Wrangling F1 Data With R*.

Although I've been dabbling with Python for some time, the origins of this book lay in my attempts at making sense of
the Python *matplotlib* graphics library using data relating to the the WRC Rally Championship.

Since then, I've also used rally data for exploring how to work with geographical data.

As with *Wrangling F1 Data With R*, this book will grow over time, with additional chapters being added over time.

If you purchase the book on Leanpub, you'll receive all future updates, *for free*, as an when they're published.
